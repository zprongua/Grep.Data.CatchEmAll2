# Catch'em All 2: The grep Edition

In the forest, our scanners have detected the presence of pokemon.

### Part 1: Catch 'em
- **a)** In the answers file, found in the greps directory, show the grep statement you used to catch each pokemon and save to a txt file, in the format `[pokemon name].txt`

- **b)** 
Save the each pokemon as a separate `.txt` file in the `captured` directory.


- **c)** In which section of the forest (which scan file) did you find each pokemon?


### Part 2: Stats
- **a)** How many pokemon are there? Show your grep that you used to get to that number.


- **b)** Who are the three biggest pokemon? (number of lines)
Show the grep that you used to get to the result.

(Hint: remember to use `ggrep -P "(whatever your pattern is)" [whatever your file is]`)
